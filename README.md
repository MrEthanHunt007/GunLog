# GunLog
GunLog is a simple Windows Forms application for managing a personal firearm collection. Users can log details about each firearm—such as make, model, caliber, serial number, price, and date acquired—and track the number of rounds fired. The application uses an SQLite database to store and manage data locally.

Features include:

Add, update, and delete firearms

Track round count per firearm

Persistent local data Storage using SQLite

Sorting will come later once my personal collection requires it.
